# lz4jsoncat

A little utility to unpack lz4json files as generated by Firefox's bookmark
backups and session restore. This is a different format from what the normal
lz4 utility expects. The data is dumped to stdout.

## Requires

Requires liblz4 (Debian package liblz4-dev, Fedora package lz4-devel) to be installed.

On MacOS, liblz4 can be installed with `brew install lz4`

## Usage

```bash
$ lz4jsoncat ~/.mozilla/.../bookmarkbackups/bookmarks-2014-12-27_151_0UCIWGB4x3hhQXpuSMs5WQ==.jsonlz4 
```

or on MacOS and exporting to file:

```bash
$ lz4jsoncat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/*default*/sessionstore-backups/recovery.json* > sessionstore.json
```

## Build

```bash
$ autoconfig
$ automake
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```
